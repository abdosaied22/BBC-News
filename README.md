# BBC News Classification ðŸ“°

This project classifies **BBC News articles** into categories such as **business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech** using both **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** techniques.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The goal is to automatically categorize BBC news articles, providing a hands-on application of text classification in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Download the BBC dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamkushwaha/bbc-full-text-document-classification) and place it inside `dataset/`.  
2. Open and run the provided notebook or script (`home.ipynb` ).  
3. Check the outputs, visualizations, and model performance results.

## ðŸ“Š Results
  
- Deep learning models (RNN, LSTM, GRU) were implemented and compared.  
- LSTM and GRU models outperformed the simple RNN.  
- Overall, GRU achieved the best accuracy on the BBC News dataset.
